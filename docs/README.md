# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Rock, paper, scissors game is an easy and fun game to use in many different situations. For example; My collegues and I often use this game to dicide who's driving to the lunch restaurant, which often leads to a good laugh.
It is also a good gamebreaker to another game has ended in an equal result.

In this case we don't need a physical person to play the game, instead we are playing against a computer wich is coded to draw a random choise each time we play.

This site is targeted towards both adults and children.
